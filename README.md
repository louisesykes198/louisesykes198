Hello my name is Louise Sykes I am just starting out in my Web Development journey.</br> 
I started out by using [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) I used video such as:</br>

I started using [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/search?query=HTML) where I started learning HTML and CSS.</br> 
I wanted to improve my skills so enrolled on the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development with Code Institute.</br>
I do have a NCFE Level 2 certificate in Understanding Coding which I received in April 2024.</br>
