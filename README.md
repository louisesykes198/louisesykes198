Hello my name is Louise Sykes I am just starting out in my Web Development journey.</br> 
I started out by using YouTube, freeCodeCamp and Codeademy where I started using HTML and CSS.</br>

I wanted to improve my skills so enrolled on the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development with Code Institute.</br>
I do have a NCFE Level 2 certificate in Understanding Coding which I received in April 2024.</br>
